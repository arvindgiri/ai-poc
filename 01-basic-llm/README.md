If you're looking to level up just a bit, without jumping into deep embeddings or transformers yet, here are 5 next-step upgrades â€” from light to slightly geeky:

ðŸ”¹ 1. TF-IDF Scoring
Why: Weigh rare but important words more than common ones.

Try: Use TfidfVectorizer from sklearn to vectorize sentences and queries, then use cosine similarity.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences + [query])
similarities = cosine_similarity(X[-1], X[:-1])
âž¡ Much better ranking than Jaccard.

ðŸ”¹ 2. BM25 Ranking
Why: It's the search engine industry standard (used by Elastic, Lucene, etc.)

Try: Use the rank_bm25 package.

python
Copy
Edit
from rank_bm25 import BM25Okapi

tokenized_corpus = [s.lower().split() for s in sentences]
bm25 = BM25Okapi(tokenized_corpus)
scores = bm25.get_scores(query.lower().split())
âž¡ More nuanced scoring than TF-IDF. Works great for QA-style stuff.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Synonym Expansion
Why: Right now, your system canâ€™t answer "What is insight meditation?" for Vipassana.

Try: Use WordNet from nltk to expand queries with synonyms.

python
Copy
Edit
from nltk.corpus import wordnet

def expand_query(query):
    words = query.lower().split()
    expanded = set(words)
    for word in words:
        for syn in wordnet.synsets(word):
            for lemma in syn.lemmas():
                expanded.add(lemma.name().replace('_', ' '))
    return list(expanded)
âž¡ Helps you catch semantically similar queries without using embeddings.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Text Normalization (Stemming/Lemmatization)
Why: Match "practicing" with "practice", etc.

Try: Use nltk.stem.PorterStemmer or WordNetLemmatizer.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Partial Word Matching / Fuzzy Matching
Why: Match typos or close spellings.

Try: Use fuzzywuzzy or RapidFuzz for approximate string matching.

ðŸ§  Bonus (If You Want to Dip Your Toes in Embeddings Later)
Try:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install sentence-transformers
python
Copy
Edit
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
query_embedding = model.encode(query)
scores = util.cos_sim(query_embedding, embeddings)
But this is optional for now â€” your lexical engine still has mileage left ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
