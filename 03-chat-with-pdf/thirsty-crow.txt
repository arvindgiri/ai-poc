Paragraph 1:
One hot summer day, a thirsty crow was flying in the sky. It looked everywhere for water but could not find any. The sun was shining very brightly, and the crow felt very tired. Its throat was dry, and it really needed to drink something. After flying for a long time, the crow saw a pot on the ground near a small house. It quickly flew down and looked inside the pot. There was a little water at the bottom. The crow was happy to see water, but it was too low for the crow to drink.

Paragraph 2:
The crow tried to reach the water with its beak, but it could not. It tried to push the pot to make the water come out, but the pot was too heavy. The crow sat on the pot and thought hard. Then it saw some small stones lying nearby. The crow got an idea! It remembered that if it put stones in the pot, the water might come up. So the crow picked up a small stone in its beak and dropped it into the pot. It decided to keep doing that again and again.

Paragraph 3:
The crow worked hard and kept putting stones into the pot one by one. After some time, the water in the pot began to rise slowly. The crow got excited and continued dropping more stones. With each stone, the water came up a little more. Finally, after many stones, the water came close to the top. Now, the crow could reach it easily. It was very happy and felt proud of itself. The smart idea had worked! The crow had used its brain and did not give up.

Paragraph 4:
The crow bent down and drank the water. It felt cool and refreshing. The crow was no longer thirsty. It smiled and looked around proudly. It knew that thinking carefully and not giving up had helped it. After resting for a short time, the crow flew away happily into the blue sky. The day had started with a problem, but the crow had solved it by using a clever idea and hard work.

Paragraph 5:
People told the crow’s story again and again. They liked how the crow used its brain to solve a problem. The story became very popular and taught a good lesson. The lesson was: “If you try hard and think smart, you can solve problems.” Even small birds or children can do great things with a little cleverness. So next time you have a problem, remember the thirsty crow—and don’t give up!
